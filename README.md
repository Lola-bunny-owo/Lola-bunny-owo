## Hi! 💚

#### I'm Angela, 23yr, Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in information retrieval, game design, and game development 💻. I’m passionate about the creative side of video games as well, especially artistic direction and sound design, where technology meets storytelling and emotion 🖌️🎶.

#### One of my proudest achievements is the demo of the game "**_A Ribbit Away_**", where I worked as one of the three main developers. I also took on the roles of art designer, sound designer, and GUI designer 👩🏻‍💻.
#### The game tells the story of _Fherb_, a frog who embarks on a journey after the mysterious disappearance of his daughter, _Fraggy_ 🐸. It’s a 2D pixel art platformer where players explore the world through a variety of mechanics that drive the narrative forward 🗺️.
#### Curious to play it? It’s available on Itch.io at this link: https://three-happy-frogs.itch.io/a-ribbit-away

#### I'm also working on another game called The Quercus Game, where I contributed once again as a developer. It was developed as part of my thesis project and focuses on raising awareness about environmental issues that affect forests — in particular, wildfires, which was the main theme I explored 🌲🔥.

#### Well, I guess that's all you need to know about me for now! Thanks for reading - and feel free to reach out if you need any help! - Angela 🌿
